## Hi 😀

My name is Kristina. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. A background in Science and Mechanical Engineering taught me logic, analytical thinking, and gave me problem-solving capabilities. With years of experience in the administrative & retail fields, I am excellent at organization, finding creative solutions to problems, and I understand the importance of communication amongst clients and teammates.

My interests include DevOps, web design, and technology. My passion for coding, learning, growth, and success encourages me to continuously expand my skill set through new technologies. I am looking forward to learning about and creating meaningful applications!
